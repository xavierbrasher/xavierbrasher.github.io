# Welcome to my repo's site.
I have some of my repo's below this 
# Name and Age Rememberer
This is a python script that taught me so much. I learnt how to open files, I learned how to use colours, and I most importantly made it fake loading screens :). [Name And Age](https://github.com/xavierbrasher/nameAndAgeRemember) 
# Sound website
A bunch of random sound effects with images. I made this in my free time and some of it is still in progress. [Sounds](https://xavierbrasher.github.io/sounds/index.html)
