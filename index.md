# Welcome to my repo's site.

I have some of my repo's below this

# Flutter Apps

I am trying to make a money counter app and a quiz app. I am learning how to do this through a course I signed up for. I really want to do this as I think it would be amazing to make an app that everyone can use. [Flutter Apps](https://github.com/xavierbrasher/Flutter-Apps)

# Stick It In

Stick it in is a game that I am creating. It is built through unity and c#. I am very excited for this game. [Stick It In](https://gitlab.com/xavierbrasher/stick-it-in)

# Name and Age Rememberer CPP!!

This is a CPP script that taught me cpp basically. I did this as I wanted name and age as an executable. I know there are many other ways to do this but I thought it would be fun to learn a new language  [Name And Age CPP](https://github.com/xavierbrasher/Name-And-Age-Remember-CPP)

# Name and Age Rememberer

This is a python script that taught me so much. I learnt how to open files, I learned how to use colours, and I most importantly made it fake loading screens :). [Name And Age](https://github.com/xavierbrasher/nameAndAgeRemember)
